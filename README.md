This is a simple Python app for downloading
YouTube Videos to a specified folder. If you
want to use this you will need to update
folder paths for your own system, and of course
you should update the folder names! You might
love coding, tech, and maker videos as much as I
do, but you should name them whatever you want.

This will be updated to check for appropriate
YouTube url, as right now it will just roll over
and die if you don't feed it a proper URL...
